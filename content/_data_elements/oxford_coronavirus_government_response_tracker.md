Systematic information on which details governments decision and measure taken and when they were taken.  This data can help decision-makers and citizens understand the robustness of governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, scores the stringency of such measures, and aggregates these scores into a common Stringency Index. Data is collected from public sources by a team of over one hundred Oxford University students and staff from every part of the world: https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus- government-response-tracker
