# About

NHS England and NHS Improvement and NHSX have established a secure NHS COVID-19 Data Store, which assimilates and protects all of the accurate, real-time information necessary to inform strategic and operational decisions in response to the current pandemic in England.

The NHS COVID&#x2011;19 Data Store is bringing in multiple data sources into a single, secure location from across the NHS and from social care and partner organisations. [All data held in the NHS COVID-19 Data Store]({{site.baseurl}}) remains under the control of the NHS at all times and is being processed in accordance with the law.
Data is being integrated, cleaned, and harmonised within analytic platforms providing additional models and simulations to support decision-making in a rapidly evolving situation. The results are presented as dashboards that give a live view of the metrics needed to track and understand the current spread of the virus, and the capacity in the healthcare system to deal with it:
* a **Public Information Dashboard**, showing statistics on cases of coronavirus and deaths associated with coronavirus in the UK, updated daily on [coronavirus.data.gov.uk](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk).
* a **Strategic Decision Makers Dashboard**, providing a national summary of situation report (SitRep) information, alongside modelling and analysis. These dashboards are designed to help senior national and regional officials to make policy and strategic decisions in response to COVID&#x2011;19.
* a **NHS Operational Dashboard**, providing local and regional NHS and local government organisations with a clear picture of what is happening both across the country and specifically in their area so that they can take the right local action.

**All data held in the NHS COVID&#x2011;19 Data Store remains under the control of the NHS at all times** and is being processed in accordance with GDPR. Policy makers, commissioners, planners and researchers will be given controlled access to dashboards and/or data appropriately and lawfully ONLY for purposes related to the COVID-19 response. To request access to dashboards or specific datasets in the NHS COVID&#x2011;19 Data Store or to request a new existing dataset is included in the NHS COVID-19 Data Store, please use the single point of contact mailbox: [covid&#x2011;19datasharing@nhsx.nhs.uk](mailto:covid-19datasharing@nhsx.nhs.uk).
