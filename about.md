# About

NHSX and NHS England and Improvement have established a secure NHS Covid-19 data store, which assimilates and protects all of the accurate, real-time information necessary to inform strategic and operational decisions in response to the current pandemic in one place.

To provide a single source of truth about the rapidly evolving situation, data is being integrated, cleaned, and harmonised within the Palantir Foundry platform, with models, simulations and analysis enabled by our AI Lab strategic partner Faculty, to support decision-making. The results are presented as dashboards that give a live view of the metrics needed to track and understand the current spread of the crisis, and the capacity in the healthcare system to deal with it:

* a **Public Information Dashboard**, showing statistics on cases of coronavirus and deaths associated with coronavirus in the UK, updated daily [here](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/).
* a **Strategic Decision Makers Dashboard**, providing a national summary of situation report (SitRep) information, alongside modelling, simulations and analysis. These dashboards are designed to help senior national and regional officials to make policy and strategic decisions in response to Covid-19. Only Government and senior regional analysts and managers are given access to this dashboard.
* an **NHS Operational Dashboard**, providing local NHS and local government organisations with a clear picture of what is happening both across the country and specifically in their area so that they can take the right local action.

**All data held in the NHS Covid-19 data store remains under the control of the NHS at all times** and is being processed in accordance with GDPR. Policy makers, commissioners, planners and researchers will be given controlled access to dashboards and/or data appropriately and lawfully ONLY for purposes related to the Covid-19 response.
