# About

### What are we doing?
The Government has commissioned NHS England and NHS Improvement and NHSX to develop a data platform that will provide those national organisations responsible for coordinating the response with secure, reliable and timely data - in a way that protects the privacy of our citizens - in order to make informed, effective decisions.

NHS England and Improvement have created a data store to bring multiple data sources into a single, secure location, namely the NHS Covid-19 Datastore. Data needed to inform the Covid-19 response has come from across the NHS, social care and partner organisations.

To provide a single source of truth about the rapidly evolving situation, data is integrated, cleaned, and harmonised in order to develop a single and reliable source of information that is needed to support decision-making.

**All NHS data in the store will remain under NHS England and NHS Improvementâ€™s control. Once the public health emergency situation has ended, data will either be destroyed or returned in line with the law and the strict contractual agreements that are in place between the NHS and partners.**


### Why are we doing it?
By consolidating information from across the NHS, social care and partner organisations we give decision-makers more accurate visibility into the status of the response. This includes metrics such as:
* Current occupancy levels at hospitals, broken down by general beds and specialist and/or critical care beds
* Current capacity of A&E departments and current waiting times
Statistics about the lengths of stay for Covid-19 patients

These metrics can be analysed from national level down to individual NHS Trusts, hospitals and GP practices. With an accurate view of these metrics in place the data allows decision-makers to answer questions about the response and explore the impact that different decisions would have. This enables a better understanding of how the virus is spreading, when and where the healthcare system will face strain, and which interventions can best mitigate the crisis.


### How is confidentiality being protected?
While moving at speed, essential data governance procedures and established principles of openness and transparency remain at the core of everything we do. We are following the same rules for information governance that underpin our day-to-day work.

The data brought into the back end datastore held by NHS England and NHS Improvement is largely from existing data sources e.g. data already collected by NHS England and NHS Improvement, Public Health England and NHS Digital. All NHS data remains under NHS England and NHS Improvement control.

All the data held in the platform is subject to strict controls that meet the requirements of data protection legislation. GDPR principles are followed, for example the data is only used for Covid-19 and not for any other purpose, only relevant information is collected and a legal basis is established before analysis is shared with any party. Any request to access data is reviewed through a single process controlled solely by NHS England and NHS Improvement and NHSX.
