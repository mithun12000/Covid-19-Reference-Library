In line with COVID&#x2011;19 [Control of Patient Information (COPI) notices](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-notification-of-data-controllers-to-share-information), issued by the Secretary of State for Health and Care, all data held in the NHS COVID&#x2011;19 Data Store always remains under the control of the NHS and is being processed in accordance with the law. The [Data Protection Impact Assessment](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/data-protection-impact-assessment-nhs-covid-19-data-store/) has been published and our [Privacy Notice](https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/privacy-notice/how-we-use-your-information/covid-19-response/nhs-covid-19-data-store/) explains what this means for patients.

The NHS COVID&#x2011;19 Reference Library describes the datasets being used in the NHS COVIDâ€‘19 Data Store, and the sources of those datasets.

Please note: the below list is not exhaustive and all planned datasets may not be included. As more data is added to support the COVID&#x2011;19 response the list will be updated.
